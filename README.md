##About CSS3 Foundations
[CSS3 Foundations](http://css3foundations.com/) is a part of the [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/) series of books, published by [John Wiley & Sons](http://wiley.com/).

[CSS3 Foundations](http://css3foundations.com/) is a hands-on approach to guide readers through the process of using CSS3 features and techniques to take a basic website template and turn it into a real-world, modern and future proof website.

From learning how to add CSS to a page, to using advanced techniques such as Responsive Web Design, each example is clear and well structured, lending to the overall main project that the book builds upon throughout.

[CSS3 Foundations](http://css3foundations.com/) tackles many of the difficulties faced when building a website; fixing inconsistencies in older browsers, safely using CSS3 features still in development, and optimizing a websites layout for the device it is being viewed upon.

If youâ€™re a web developer, web designer, hobbyist, or career-changer, every book in the Treehouse series should be on your bookshelf.
